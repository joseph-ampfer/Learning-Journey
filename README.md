# Learning-Journey
My developer learning journey.

### My Journey Through Harvard's CS50

#### Week 0: Scratch
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to the basics of computer science
  - Understanding algorithms
  - Creating simple programs using Scratch

- **Problem Set:**
  - Design and implement a simple animation, game, or interactive art using Scratch
 
- **My Games**
  - github.com/joseph-ampfer/Jumpy-Game
  - github.com/joseph-ampfer/My-Pong

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - I loved working on my games. The thrill of seeing something you imagined and coded actually working was amazing. I knew then that I wanted to dive deeper into software engineering.
  - I got stuck on how to get the physics right on pong. I was thinking of having the incoming angle of the ball and outgoing angle be correct. After thinking it over, searching formulas, and trying implemenations that did not work, I had an aha moment that I could set the angle to be random within a certain interval, and the game would still be fun. I found the randomness of the angle added to the fun of the game, because it was harder to predict.

#### Week 1: C
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to the C programming language
  - Basics of programming concepts like loops, conditions, and variables

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement programs in C, "Hello, World", a simple or complex Mario pyramid, and a cash change calculator

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Transitioning to C from Scratch
  - Understanding new programming concepts in C
  - I tried to tackle the complex Mario pyramid first and found it a little overwhelming, so I went back to simple pyramid. From there, I found out that I could make the backwards pyramid pretty easily, and from there get the solution. Once I had that solution, the complex Mario pyramid came easily.
  - I learned that breaking a hard problem down to a smaller and easier to understand base can simplify the whole process.

#### Week 2: Arrays
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Understanding arrays and complex data structures
  - More advanced algorithms

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement programs that manipulate arrays of data, such as a sorting algorithm

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Grasping array manipulation
  - Implementation of sorting algorithms

#### Week 3: Algorithms
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Delving deeper into algorithms
  - Searching and sorting

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement programs that execute more complex algorithms, like search algorithms

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Understanding efficiency in algorithms
  - Practical implementation challenges

#### Week 4: Memory
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Memory management
  - Pointers and file I/O

- **Problem Set:**
  - Programs that manipulate memory and use pointers

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Understanding pointers and memory allocation
  - Debugging memory-related issues

#### Week 5: Data Structures
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash tables

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implementation of data structures in program solutions

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Understanding and implementing various data structures
  - Application of data structures to solve complex problems

#### Week 6: Python
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Transition from C to Python
  - Python syntax and features

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement similar programs from earlier weeks in Python

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Adapting to Python from C
  - Leveraging Python features in problem-solving

#### Week 7: SQL
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Basics of database management using SQL
  - Querying and updating databases

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement programs that interact with databases using SQL

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Understanding database concepts
  - SQL syntax and query optimization

#### Week 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to web development
  - Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- **Problem Set:**
  - Develop a simple web page or application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Designing and implementing web interfaces
  - Integrating JavaScript for web functionality

#### Week 9: Flask
- **Topics Covered:**
  - Introduction to Flask
  - Building dynamic websites

- **Problem Set:**
  - Implement a more complex web application using Flask

- **Reflections and Challenges:**
  - Understanding web application frameworks
  - Managing server-side scripting

#### Week 10: Final Project
- Worked on my final project, AMPFER Finance
- github.com/joseph-ampfer/AmpferFinance
